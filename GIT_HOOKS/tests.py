# A hook script to check the commit log message.
# Called by "git commit" with one argument, the name of the file
# that has the commit message. The hook should exit with non-zero
# status after issuing an appropriate message if it wants to stop the
# commit. The hook is allowed to edit the commit message file.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "commit-msg".

Your commit message must contains at least one reference
to a GitHub issue e.g.:

#123 Fix a Bug ðŸª²
#123 #321 Fix a Bug ðŸª²

On GitHub Desktop in the commit Summary field, typing # (hashtag)
will trigger suggestions of issues to reference.

You can also pick one of the issues on GitHub
issues

If no issue match your commit maybe creating one would be a
good idea ðŸ˜‰

Cheers ðŸ‘‹
