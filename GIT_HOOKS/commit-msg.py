# A hook script to check the commit log message.
# Called by "git commit" with one argument, the name of the file
# that has the commit message. The hook should exit with non-zero
# status after issuing an appropriate message if it wants to stop the
# commit. The hook is allowed to edit the commit message file.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "commit-msg".

On GitHub Desktop in the commit Summary field, typing # (hashtag) will trigger
suggestions of issues to reference.

You can also pick one of the issues on GitHub
{commit['github'][:-4]}/issues

You can point to another repo's issues as such
owner/repo#digit e.g.: ulynks/docs#38 Fix a Bug ðŸª²

If no issue match your commit maybe creating one would be a good idea ðŸ˜‰
