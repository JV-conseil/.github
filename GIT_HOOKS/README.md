Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository. They let you customize Git‚Äôs internal behavior and trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle.

Common use cases for Git hooks include encouraging a commit policy, altering the project environment depending on the state of the repository, and implementing continuous integration workflows. But, since scripts are infinitely customizable, you can use Git hooks to automate or optimize virtually any aspect of your development workflow.

In this article, we‚Äôll start with a conceptual overview of how Git hooks work. Then, we‚Äôll survey some of the most popular hooks for use in both local and server-side repositories.
